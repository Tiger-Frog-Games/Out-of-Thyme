This project was created over the course of a few days to showcase my programming skills to a potential employer. Since this is an interview piece, its a bit rough around the edges especially with moving and picking up items normally. I would use a asset called ecm2 and sensor toolkit 2 to handle those but I wanted to only add stuff I created my self. (Thought I did use one free asset First Gear games fast object pooler). The balance is a bit rough for one player. Good for two and easy mode 3 and 4.
